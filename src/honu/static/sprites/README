Tile colors are from https://chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/theme#colors

Most colors are COLOR 400 (ex. Red 400)
Black is Gray 700
Brown is Yellow 700

Files must be in .gif format to prevent problems in older versions of Tkinter.
Not doing so may result in incompatibility with macOS and perhaps Windows.
